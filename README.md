#  Restaurant Website 
 üöÄ Excited to Share My Latest Project: A Responsive Restaurant Website Built with React! üçΩÔ∏è

 Over the past few days, I've been working on a dynamic and responsive restaurant website using React. This project allowed me to dive deep into React's powerful capabilities, particularly with state management and reusable components. Here's a quick overview of what I accomplished and how it works:

Key Features:
Dynamic Menu Filtering: The website features a dynamic menu that allows users to filter items based on categories like Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. This is achieved using React's useState hook and custom filtering functions.

Reusable Components:

Navbar: Contains buttons for each category and updates the displayed items based on user interaction.
MenuCard: Displays each menu item with details such as name, category, description, and image.
Responsive Design: Ensured the website is fully responsive and looks great on all devices by leveraging CSS flexbox and media queries.

Technologies Used:
React: For building the user interface and managing state.
CSS: For styling the components and ensuring responsiveness.
JavaScript: For dynamic functionality and interactivity.

This project was a fantastic learning experience and I'm thrilled to share it with the community. Feel free to check out the code, provide feedback, or reach out if you have any questions!
